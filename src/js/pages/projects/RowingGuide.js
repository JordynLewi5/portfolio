                Rowing Guide is a website that I created to help rowers and coaches
                learn and teach the sport of rowing. It contains a collection of helpful lessons, diagrams,
                and more. It is currently in development, and I am working on adding more content to it. This project uses
                WordPress as a CMS and a custom theme.
